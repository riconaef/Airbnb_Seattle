## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run in Python 3 with no problems. No additional packages are needed. 

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project I was interested in analysing an airbnb dataset of Seattle with the focus on the price:

1. How does the spatial distribution look like? Are there reasons for higher prices in certain regions?
2. How much money was generated by each airbnb accommodation? 
3. What other factors influence the price?

The used data can also be downloaded here. The "calendar" file is a large file, thus it was separated into two files. 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Part I:<\n>
The dataframe "listings" has the shape of 3818 rows × 92 columns. To have an image of the spatial distribution I chose
the coordinate data "latitude" and "longitude". By rounding to 2 digits the accommodations can be grouped with
same coordinates. 
Since the price is a string it has to be changed to a float. Before, the string has to be cleaned from non-convertable
characters (e.g. $). 
With the use of a pivot-table the data are grouped. The value of the pivot-table is set to the price-column. Additionally 
the mean function was applied to calculate the average prices for accommodations with the same coordinates. 

Part II:
For this step the prepared dataframe from Part I is used with an additional dataframe "calendar" containing the bookings of 
all airbnb's. This new dataframe has the shape 1393570 rows × 4 columns. 

In the calendar dataframe, all NAN were removed to just have the booked nights left with their prices. In the two dataframes
we got now, the airbnb id column name is different. Therefore, the "listing_id"-column in the dataframe is changed to "id". 
Next, all bookings with the same id are grouped together and sumed up. So we have the income for the whole year for each 
accommodation. 
After the two dataframes are merged together on the id column. The obtained dataframe contains the total income per year and
their location. Again a pivot-table is created similar to Part I.

Part III:
To evaluate the importance of other features, a linear Regression model from the sklearn package has been used.
The data had to be cleaned first with the function "clean_data". This function takes a dataframe and a integer called "flag".

1.  The first step is optional. If the flag variable is set to 1, the function "separator" is used. 
    This function will separate the column "amenities" into different columns. The problem with the "amenities" column is that there
    are plenty of variables packed into one string for each row, without any order. The function returns a new dataframe containing 
    only the "amenities" column packed into an ordered dataframe. This new dataframe has a column for each amenity. For all accommodations
    it shows wether this particular amenity is available or not. This dataframe is concatenated with the original dataframe. 

2.  Some columns contain an "t" or "f". These are change into 1 and 0 which are easier to handle.
